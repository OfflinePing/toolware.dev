# Toolware.dev - Your systems wingman

Toolware.dev is a toolbox created to simply the life of developers and system administrators. It was created around a year ago from me and not really maintained. In the last few months I've realized the benefits this project creates and started recoding it better, cleaner. 


## Deployment

Everyone is able to host this project for himself with yarn or even pm2 as a permanent solution. 

The public solution is based on Google Cloud Build which creates a docker image from this source code after a tag named "release-X" was added from me.



## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome! The project is only open-source to create a huge tool which is only possible with you as a contributor.

You can create a pull request inside the issues tab as well as feature requests and bugs you've found. After a review I'll give you a feedback.
